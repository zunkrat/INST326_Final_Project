# INST326_Final_Project

    An explanation of the purpose of each file in your repository:
       
        [10_21_23_paystub.txt, 10_7_23_paystub.txt, 11_4_23_paystub.txt,
        8_26_23_paystub.txt, 9_23_23_paystub.txt]: 
        These are text files of Christian's paystubs from the corresponding dates in the format that was             used to create the regular expressions, so extraction from other paystubs with a different format            might not be accurate.

    In the table, list all methods and functions that are being claimed by any member of the group in fulfillment of item 7 above. Only list the techniques that are being claimed in fulfillment of item 7d (for example, three functions may contain f-strings, but only one member of the group can claim f-strings and they should only be listed once in the table).
